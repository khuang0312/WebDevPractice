https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element - VERY HANDY...

header - big strip across the top with a big heading and/or logo; main common info
navigation bar - inks to the site's main sections; often considered part of header
main content - contains most of the unique content of a given webpage
side bar - Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc.
footer -  generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info; common info not important enough to be in header

header: <header>.
navigation bar: <nav>.
main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside <main>.
footer: <footer>.

=====================================================================================================================================
<main> 
-content unique to this page
-only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. 
-Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.

<article> 
-encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).

<section> 
-similar to <article>
-more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality 
 (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break <article>s up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s, depending on the context.

<aside> 
-contains content not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it 
 (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.)

<header> 
-represents a group of introductory content. 
-If it is a child of <body> it defines the global header of a webpage, 
-If it's a child of an <article> or <section> it defines a specific header for that section 
 (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).
 
<nav> 
-contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.

<footer> 
-represents a group of end content for a page.
=================================================================================================================================
These are handy if you want to add CSS and JS but can't think of an semantic way to do so

<span> is an inline non-semantic element
<div> is a block level non-semantic element
=================================================================================================================================
<br> - line break
<hr> - horizontal rule
