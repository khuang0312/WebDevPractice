The humble href
===========================================================================================
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
   title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
          
href - hypertext reference, target attribute
link title - only revealed on mouse hover; if it's that important, just render it on page

just wrap anything with this!

URLS
==============================================================================================
basically file paths

root directory contains the index html that is the main landing point for our site

accessing another file in the same directory
<a href="other_file.html"></a>

accessing file in a sub-directory
<a href="sub-directory_name/other_file.html"></a>

moving back up to a file in a parent directory
<a href="../other_file.html"></a>

these can be chained...
<a href="../../../other_file.html"></a>



document fragments - specific part of an HTML Document
to link to one, assign an id attribute to an element (often an heading)

<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>
<p>Want to write us a letter? Use our <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.</p>

Put #id after the HTML file the fragment is in

<p>The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> can be found at the bottom of this page.</p>

If the fragment is in the same file, just put the #id 



Best Practices
=========================================================================================================
absolute URL: Points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name

http://www.example.com/projects/index.html
http://www.example.com/projects/ (web servers usually select index.html if file not specified)

relative URL:  Points to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from

pdfs/project-brief.pdf

Screenreaders jump around link to link and can read links out of context
Search engines use links to target index files 
People skim

Therefore...

Don't actually type links out (UGLY!)
Don't say "links to" or variants...
Keep link labels short 
Minimize duplicate link labels

Use relative links when possible (easier to scan, more efficient since it searches local server instead of DNS)
Absolute links are only when the link is another website's

Linking to sources that will be downloaded -- add clear wording

<p><a href="http://www.example.com/car-game">
  Play the car game (requires Flash)
</a></p>

Use download attribute to provide a default file name

<a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US"
   download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
  Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
</a>


Email links
================================================================================================================================
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

leaving email out allows user to specify whom to send their email...

<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
</a>

The values of each field must be URL-encoded (certain symbols must be escaped with %)
? separates each field
This is standard URL notation... for GET Method...
