==================================================================================================================================
different browsers support different video (and audio) formats

container formats (MP3, WEBM)
contain different parts that make up the whole song or video: audio track, visual track, metadata

 audio and video tracks are also in different formats
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility
 
 Browsers contain different Codecs, like Vorbis or H.264, which are used to convert the compressed sound and video 
 into binary digits and back. As indicated above, browsers unfortunately don't all support the same codecs, so you will have to 
 provide several files for each media production. If you're missing the right codec to decode the media, it just won't play.
 
 video controls width="400" height="400"
       autoplay loop muted
       poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

the browser will go through the <source> elements and play the first one that it has the codec to support. 
Including WebM and MP4 sources should be enough to play your video on most platforms and browsers these days.
Each <source> element also has a optional type attribute, but it is advised that you include them 
— they contain the MIME types of the video files, and browsers can read these and immediately skip videos they don't understand.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats

width and height
You can control the video size either with these attributes or with CSS. 
In both cases, videos maintain their native width-height ratio — known as the aspect ratio. 
If the aspect ratio is not maintained by the sizes you set, 
the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, and the unfilled space will just be given a solid background color by default.

autoplay
Makes the audio or video start playing right away, while the rest of the page is loading. 
You are advised not to use autoplaying video (or audio) on your sites, because users can find it really annoying.

loop
Makes the video (or audio) start playing again whenever it finishes. This can also be annoying, so only use if really necessary.

muted
Causes the media to play with the sound turned off by default.

poster
The URL of an image which will be displayed before the video is played. 
It is intended to be used for a splash screen or advertising screen.

preload
Used for buffering large files; it can take one of three values:
"none" does not buffer the file
"auto" buffers the media file

"metadata" buffers only the metadata for the file
======================================================================================================================================================

Audio pretty much supports everything except width, height, and poster

reset the media to the beginning—including the process of selecting the best media source by calling load method

var mediaElem = document.getElementById("my-media-element");
mediaElem.load();

detecting track addition and removal
var mediaElem = document.querySelector("video");
mediaElem.audioTracks.onaddtrack = function(event) {
  audioTrackAdded(event.track);
}

Subtitles

<track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en">
WebVTT format

subtitles
Translations of foreign material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.

captions
Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, 
to let people who can't hear the audio understand what is going on.

timed descriptions
Text for conversion into audio, to serve people with visual impairments.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video

1. Save it as a .vtt file in a sensible place.
2. Link to the .vtt file with the <track> element. 
3. <track> should be placed within <audio> or <video>, but after all <source> elements. 
Use the kind attribute to specify whether the cues are subtitles, captions, or descriptions. 
Further, use srclang to tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in.
