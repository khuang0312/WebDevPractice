</iframe>

<iframe> elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document. 

allowfullscreen
If set, the <iframe> is able to be placed in fullscreen mode using the Full Screen API (somewhat beyond scope for this article.)

frameborder
If set to 1, this tells the browser to draw a border between this frame and other frames, which is the default behaviour. 
0 removes the border. Using this isn't really recommended any more, as the same effect can be better achieved 
using border: none; in your CSS.

src
This attribute, as with <video>/<img>, contains a path pointing to the URL of the document to be embedded.

width and height
These attributes specify the width and height you want the iframe to be.

Fallback content
In the same way as other similar elements like <video>, you can include fallback content between the 
opening and closing <iframe></iframe> tags that will appear if the browser doesn't support the <iframe>. 
In this case, we have included a link to the page instead. It is unlikely that you'll come across any browser 
that doesn't support <iframe>s these days.

sandbox
This attribute, which works in slightly more modern browsers than the rest of the <iframe> features (e.g. IE 10 and above) 
requests heightened security settings; we'll say more about this in the next section.

set the iframe's src attribute with JavaScript after the main content is done with loading. 
This makes your page usable sooner and decreases your official page load time (an important SEO metric.)

Only embed when necessary

Use HTTPS

Always use the sandbox attribute
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox
never add both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin to your sandbox attribute — in that case, 
the embedded content could bypass the same origin security policy that stops sites from executing scripts, 
and use JavaScript to turn off sandboxing altogether.

Configure CSP directives

 <embed> and <object> elements serve a different function to <iframe> — 
 these elements are general purpose embedding tools for embedding multiple types of external content, 
 which include plugin technologies like Java Applets and Flash, PDF (which can be shown in a browser with a PDF plugin), 
 and even content like videos, SVG and images!
 
 plugin - software that provides access to content the browser cannot read natively.
 
 honestly though, you really shouldn't use these plug-ins...
