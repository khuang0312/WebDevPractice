<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"> better for SEO purposes
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg"> absolute link 

Do not display an image on your webpage unless:

1) you own the image
2) you have received explicit, written permission from the image's owner, or
3) you have ample proof that the image is, in fact, in the public domain.

hotlinking - pointing src attribute at an image hosted on someone else's website that you don't have permission to link to

don't do this, this slows your page and illegally steals somebody else's bandwidth

alt attribute
====================================================================================================================================
textual description of the image used: 
when the image cannot be seen/displayed
takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.

Decoration. 
Use CSS background images for decorative images; otherwise, add a blank alt="". 

Content. 
If your image provides significant information, use brief alt text or the main text!
Don't write redundant alt text.
If the image is described adequately by the main text, you can just use alt="".

Link. 
If you put an image inside <a> tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide accessible link text. 
Write it inside the same <a> element, or inside the image's alt attribute

Text. 
You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, use CSS.
Supply the text inside the alt attribute if you can't avoid this...

width, height, title attributes
===================================================================================================================================
TLDR: Don't really modify these, use CSS instead

title attribute - can have support text, but it's better to put it in the main text instead...

Figures and captions
===================================================================================================================================
<figure>
  <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
       alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
            it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
       width="400"
       height="341">

  <figcaption>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</figcaption>
</figure>

Figures: a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.

figcaptions are for those who can see the image
alt text is when they can't see the image
Therefore, don't have them say the same thing!


CSS Background images
====================================================================================================================================
p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}

This will apply a background image to every paragraph
This is not semantic; this is unable to convey any other meaningful info
