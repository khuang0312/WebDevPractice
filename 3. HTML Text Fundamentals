Headers
=====================================================================
<h1> all the way to <h6>

It's best to have one <h1> per page
Don't do <h3> before <h2> or anything of the like...
Try to only have 3 levels of headers

Readers should be able to see things within minutes if not seconds
Heading contents affect search results
Screen readers use headers to provide outlines for readers
Elements need to wrap content in order for CSS/JS to target it

Importance of semantic code
======================================================================
Use the right elements: headers, paragraphs, etc.

Non-semantic code (code without particularly special meanings)
<span>content that you want to wrap with JS or CSS</span>

unordered lists
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>

ordered lists
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>

nested lists - try sticking ul or ol elements inside li elements

Emphasis
=============================================================================
<em> -> italics by default...
<span> and CSS or <i> is better though

<strong> -> bold by default
<span> and CSS or <b> is better...

<u> - underline...

presentational elements - only affect presentation and not semantics...
<i> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by italic: Foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought...
<b> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by bold: Key words, product names, lead sentence...
<u> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: Proper name, misspelling... (strong association with links)

only use these3 if you can't come up with suitable alternatives to convey what you mean...
